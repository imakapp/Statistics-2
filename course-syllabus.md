# Course Title: Statistics 2 for BS in Data Science and Applications

## Course Overview
Statistics 2 builds on foundational statistical concepts covered in Statistics 1, focusing on advanced methods and their applications in data science. The course integrates theoretical understanding with practical data analysis techniques using computational tools.

## Learning Objectives
1. To understand advanced statistical methods applicable to data science.
2. To develop proficiency in using statistical software for data analysis.
3. To apply statistical techniques to real-world datasets.
4. To interpret and communicate results from statistical analyses effectively.
